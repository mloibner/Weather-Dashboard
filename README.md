# Weather-Dashboard

The Weather-Dashboard is an app used to find the daily and weekly forecast of a city you select.

## Usage

Use the search input on the left to type in the city of your choosing. When selected you will be presented with the dauly forecast for that city. The forecast includes: date, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The UV index background color will change depedning on the risk category the index falls into according to the international standard measurement of ultraviolet radiation. You are also presented with a 5 day forecast for that city. 
On the left, when you submit a city, that city will be saved in LocalStorage and made available in the future. When you click on any city in your displayed list, that city will then act as the input city and your page will present that city's data.
